Getting Started
===============

Pages
------
Pages - are classes that’s describe real web pages. For example,  'Home page' can be described as:

```ruby
class HomePage < WebPage
end
```

Thus, we realize that each page is inherited from a parent class 'Web Page', which contains the common methods for all pages.

Each page contains 2 required constants:

1. URL - the relative URL of the page
2. URL_PATTERN - a regular expression that uniquely identifies the page

**Example 1:**

```ruby
class HomePage < WebPage
  URL = '/'
  URL_PATTERN = /#{Regexp.escape(settings.app_host)}\/?\z/
end
```

**Example 2:**
If we want to describe login page, which are located at: https://test.com/users/sign_in

```ruby
class LoginPage < WebPage
  URL = '/users/sign_in'
  URL_PATTERN = /sign_in\z/
end
```

Locators
---------

Locator is a search item (selector) of one or more elements on a 'Web page'.

The table below lists the types of locators, the possible methods of searching and Capybara methods, which may be called.


Locator Type      | Search Methods           | Capybara Methods
:----------------:|:------------------------:|:----------------------------:
locator           |css(by default), path     | find, all, first
link_locator      |id, text                  | click_link, find_link
field_locator     |id, name, text            | find_field, fill_in
button_locator    |id, name, text            | click_button, find_button

Each page contains a description of all elements by adding the appropriate locators that are preceded by the prefix **add_**

**Example:**
```ruby
class HomePage < WebPage
  URL = '/'
  URL_PATTERN = /#{Regexp.escape(settings.app_host)}\/?\z/

  add_locator :test_locator_name1,  '.foo'                         #css locator, default
  add_locator :test_locator_name2,  css: '.foo'                    #css locator
  add_locator :test_locator_name3,  xpath: '//div[@value="bar"]'   #css locator

  add_link_locator :test_link_locator1, 'Foo'                      #link locator by 'Foo' text
  add_link_locator :test_link_locator1, 'bar'                      #link locator by 'bar' id

  add_field_locator :test_field_locator1, 'Foo'                    #field locator by 'Foo' text
  add_field_locator :test_field_locator2, 'bar'                    #field locator by 'bar' id
  add_field_locator :test_field_locator3, 'bas'                    #field locator by 'baz' name
end
```
Pages with static information
-----------------------------
In case of repeated static information in several different pages, it would be good decision to move up these methods into separate module.

**Example:**
```ruby
module TopMenu
  def self.included(base)
    base.class_eval do
      add_link_locator :test_link_locator1, 'Foo'
    end
  end

  def open_menu
    log.info "Open menu"
    click_link locator(:test_link_locator1)
  end
end
```
Redefining of the *open* method
-------------------------------
It is used when you need to open a page with additional parameters.

**Example:**
```ruby
class MyPage < WebPage
  def self.open(url="#{app_url}#{self::URL}+'?no_popup=true'")
    super
  end
end
```

Good practice
-------------

**First rule:** do not get tied to the interface. Thats means that the name and description of the methods you should use a common phrases.

**Example:**
```ruby
class MyPage < WebPage
  def submit_form
    …
  end

  def fill_form(value)
    …
  end
end
```
**Second rule:** any ACTION methods should return an instance of the page.
This allows you to do the following:

```ruby
MyPage.open.fill_form.submit_form
```
**Example:**
```
class MyPage < WebPage
  def fill_form
  ..............
  MyPage.given
  end
end
```

**Third rule:** coding of checks in the methods in the class pages are __prohibited.__

**Example:**
```ruby
class MyPage < WebPage
  def submit_form
    ….
  end

  def get_all_prices
    …
   prices
  end
end
```
my_page_spec.rb
```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe “some feature” do
  context “when...” do
    it {expect(MyPage.get_all_prices).to include(400)}
  end
end
```
**Fourth rule:** all ACTION methods should create log entries

**Example:**
```ruby
class MyPage < WebPage
  def submit_form
    log.info { "[ACTION] Submit form" }
    ….
  end

  def fill_form
    log.info { "[ACTION] Fill form" }
    …
  end
end
```

Email
-----
_**Email**_ class uses `Mailgun` gem and allows you to work with the mailbox.
Class corresponds to one letter. Used to test the notifications.

**.find_by_recipient (recipient)** - search for the letter recipient. The parameter receives email recipient.

**.find (recipient, subject)** - same as the **self.find_by_recipient (recipient)**, but only in case, when we do not know in advance what kind of _subject_ has email.

**\#plain_text_body** - receiving text of messages

**\#get_mime_part** - allows you to receive the attachment of email

Exapmle:
```ruby
class MyEmail < Email
  SUBJECT = 'TEST SUBJECT' # specify the subject of an email
end
```

Exapmle, how custom class might look like:
```ruby
class MyEmail <Email
  SUBJECT = "Test email" # specify the subject of an email

  def addressed_to? (new_user) # check that the letter were sent to proper recipient
    / Hi # {new_user} / === plain_text_body
  end
end
```
